Skill configuration and reference metadata for AI assistants.

## Contents
- `fallout1-rebirth/SKILL.md`: project-specific operating guidance.
- `README.md`: directory reference.
- `JOURNAL.md`: change history for this directory.

## Maintenance Rules
- Keep `SKILL.md` aligned with current script locations and naming.
- If script layout changes, update both this directory docs and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Follow the journal sync rule: update `JOURNAL.md` after any file change in this directory.
- Enforce global doc hygiene in guidance: if a directory has `JOURNAL.md`, read it before edits and update it after edits.
