FALLOUT 1 REBIRTH (macOS)
=========================

From DMG to playing
1) Open the DMG and drag "Fallout 1 Rebirth.app" to Applications (or another folder such as ~/Games/Fallout1).
2) If the DMG name ends with "-with-data.dmg", the game data is already inside the app bundle. Skip to step 5.
3) Get the original Fallout 1 data from GOG or Steam: master.dat, critter.dat, and the entire data/ folder.
4) Place "Fallout 1 Rebirth.app", master.dat, critter.dat, and the data/ folder together in the same folder. Keep file names lowercase.
5) First launch: right-click the app and choose Open. If macOS blocks it, run:
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "Fallout 1 Rebirth.app"
   (or allow via System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway).
6) Configure (optional): edit fallout.cfg and f1_res.ini next to the app. For the bundled-with-data build they live in Contents/MacOS.
7) Play: double-click "Fallout 1 Rebirth.app". Saves stay beside the executable.

Notes
- Do not run the app directly from the mounted DMG; copy it out first.
- Keep master.dat, critter.dat, and data/ next to the app unless you are using the bundled-with-data DMG.
