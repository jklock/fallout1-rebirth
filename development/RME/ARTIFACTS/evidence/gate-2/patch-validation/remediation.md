# RME Patch Validation — Remediation Report

Date: 2026-02-10
Executor: GitHub Copilot (automation)

Summary: FAIL — validation discovered checksum mismatches and missing patch payload files that must be addressed before gate-2 can be considered clean.

Top issues (priority order):
1. master.dat checksum mismatch (expected a79090..., actual fbfa03...) — critical base DAT mismatch. See: `development/RME/ARTIFACTS/evidence/gate-2/patch-validation/checksums-verify.txt`
2. critter.dat checksum mismatch (expected 668008..., actual 69cdf6...) — critical base DAT mismatch. See checksums report above.
3. DATA/ART/INTRFACE/INTRFACE.LST checksum mismatch — LST differs from RME payload; may indicate different interface assets or LST replacement.
4. DATA/SCRIPTS/SCRIPTS.LST checksum mismatch — scripts index differs; may break script mapping.
5. Missing RME payload files referenced by checksums: `critter.xdelta`, `master.xdelta`, `readme.txt` — patch payload files not present in overlay (missing deltas/files expected by RME).

Other findings:
- `rebirth-refresh-validation.sh` produced a comprehensive set of reports in `development/RME/ARTIFACTS/evidence/gate-2/patch-validation/refresh/` (including `unpatched_vs_patched.diff` and `rme-crossref` raw outputs) — useful for merging/inspection.
- `GOG/patchedfiles` contains ~130 files not referenced in `third_party/rme/checksums.txt` (fonts, maps, music, edg files, etc.). These are listed in the checksums verification artifact and should be audited to decide whether they are expected payload additions or extras that require removal or inclusion in checksums.
- art CRITTERS.LST and proto CRITTERS.LST are identical between `GOG/patchedfiles` and `third_party/rme/source`; no diff recorded (`critters-lst-diff.txt` and `proto-critters-lst-diff.txt`).

Recommended immediate remediation steps (short-term):
1. Restore canonical base DATs: ensure `master.dat` and `critter.dat` in `GOG/patchedfiles` match the expected checksums in `third_party/rme/checksums.txt`. If the present files are intentionally different, update the checksums file and record the rationale.
2. Locate and add missing RME payload files (`critter.xdelta`, `master.xdelta`, `readme.txt`) into `GOG/patchedfiles` as expected by the validation scripts (or update checksums if they are intentionally omitted).
3. Inspect `DATA/ART/INTRFACE/INTRFACE.LST` and `DATA/SCRIPTS/SCRIPTS.LST` diffs using the refresh output (see `development/RME/ARTIFACTS/evidence/gate-2/patch-validation/refresh/raw/unpatched_vs_patched.diff` and `rme-xref` reports). Decide whether to adopt RME's LSTs or merge the current overlay changes; then re-run validations.
4. Audit unexpected extras (listed in `checksums-verify.txt`) and either remove or add them to `third_party/rme/checksums.txt` (if they are part of the intended payload). Prioritize font/map/music files that could affect game behavior.
5. After remediation, re-run these validation steps (rebirth-validate-data.sh, rebirth-refresh-validation.sh, rme-crossref, checksum verification) and confirm all checks pass.

Artifacts & paths (key outputs):
- rebirth-validate-data log: `development/RME/ARTIFACTS/evidence/gate-2/patch-validation/rebirth-validate-data.txt`
- rebirth-refresh-validation logs and raw outputs: `development/RME/ARTIFACTS/evidence/gate-2/patch-validation/rebirth-refresh-validation.txt` and `.../refresh/`
- rme cross-reference: `development/RME/ARTIFACTS/evidence/gate-2/patch-validation/rme-crossref.txt` and `.../rme-xref/`
- checksums verification: `development/RME/ARTIFACTS/evidence/gate-2/patch-validation/checksums-verify.txt` (contains missing/mismatches/unexpected extras)
- LST diffs: `development/RME/ARTIFACTS/evidence/gate-2/patch-validation/critters-lst-diff.txt` and `proto-critters-lst-diff.txt`

Notes & next steps:
- No fatal errors encountered while running the validation scripts; all tools completed successfully. The results indicate content/state inconsistencies that require human review and remediation.
- If you want, I can: (a) generate a targeted list of files to restore/replace from RME payload, (b) produce a PR-ready patchset that replaces the mismatched LSTs with RME versions, or (c) run the validation again after you apply fixes.
