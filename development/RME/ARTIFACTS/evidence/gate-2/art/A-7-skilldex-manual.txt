A-7 Skilldex manual verification - artifact

Automated check: No FRM/PAL files matching ADDICT/DRUGREST/REPCHILD were found in GOG/patchedfiles/data/art (see A-7-skilldex.txt).

Manual test steps:
1) Launch the game (local build or simulator) and open the Skilldex UI.
2) Locate entries for Addiction/Drug Rest/Rep Child (or similar skill names). Verify the icon and label are present and not blank/placeholder.
3) Record the screen or take screenshots for each missing item.
4) If icons/graphics are missing or incorrect, collect game log (patch log) and attach screenshots and logs to this artifact folder.

Notes:
- This check requires opening the UI in-game; it cannot be verified by file presence alone.
- Owner: RME team (assign to person who performs manual verification)
