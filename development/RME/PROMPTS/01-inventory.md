# Subagent Prompt #1: Repository-Wide RME Inventory

## Mission

You are a research agent. Your task is to inventory **every RME-related file** across the entire Fallout 1 Rebirth repository. The repository is located at `/Volumes/Storage/GitHub/fallout1-rebirth`.

RME = "Restoration Mod Extended" version 1.1e — a community mod pack for Fallout 1.

## What to Do

### Step 1: Scan All Directories

Search these directories for any file related to RME integration:

1. **`development/RME/`** — Primary RME development docs. List every file and subdirectory.
   ```
   find development/RME/ -type f | sort
   ```

2. **`development/archive/`** — Archived/obsolete files that may have been moved from RME.
   ```
   find development/archive/ -type f | sort
   ```

3. **`GOG/`** — Game data directories used for patching.
   ```
   ls -la GOG/
   ls -la GOG/rme_1/
   ls -la GOG/rme_xref_patched/
   ls -la GOG/rme_xref_unpatched/
   ls -la GOG/patchedfiles/
   ls -la GOG/patchedfiles-case/
   ls -la GOG/unpatchedfiles/
   ```

4. **`third_party/rme/`** — RME source/reference files.
   ```
   find third_party/rme/ -type f | sort
   ```

5. **`src/`** — Engine source code with RME-related modifications. Search for:
   - Files containing "rme", "RME", "patchlog", "restoration"
   - Modified files: `proto.cc`, `map.cc`, `tile.cc`, `object.cc`, `main.cc`, `svga.cc`, `db.cc`
   ```
   grep -rl "rme\|RME\|patchlog\|restoration\|RESTORATION" src/ --include="*.cc" --include="*.h"
   ```

6. **`scripts/`** — Patching and validation scripts.
   ```
   find scripts/patch/ -type f | sort
   find scripts/dev/ -type f | sort
   ```

7. **`docs/`** — Any documentation referencing RME.
   ```
   grep -l "rme\|RME\|restoration" docs/*.md
   ```

8. **`cmake/`** — Any CMake files referencing RME.
   ```
   grep -rl "rme\|RME" cmake/
   ```

9. **`gameconfig/`** — Config files that may have RME-specific settings.
   ```
   find gameconfig/ -type f | sort
   ```

### Step 2: Classify Each File

For every file found, record:

| Field | Description |
|-------|------------|
| **Full Path** | Absolute path from repo root |
| **Purpose** | One-line description of what this file does |
| **Status** | `ACTIVE` (in use), `ARCHIVED` (moved to archive), `STALE` (outdated but not archived), `GENERATED` (output of a script) |
| **Category** | `PLAN`, `TODO`, `EVIDENCE`, `SCRIPT`, `DATA`, `SOURCE`, `CONFIG`, `DOCS`, `CROSSREF`, `ARTIFACT` |

### Step 3: Flag Issues

Identify and report:

1. **Duplicates** — Files with the same or overlapping content in different locations
2. **Contradictions** — Files that make conflicting claims (e.g., different file counts, different mod lists)
3. **Orphans** — Files referenced by other docs but that don't exist
4. **Stale references** — Files that reference paths or scripts that no longer exist

### Step 4: Return Organized Inventory

Return your results organized by directory, in this format:

```
## development/RME/
| Path | Purpose | Status | Category |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## development/archive/
| Path | Purpose | Status | Category |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## GOG/
...

## Issues Found
### Duplicates
- ...
### Contradictions
- ...
### Orphans
- ...
```

## Constraints

- Do NOT modify any files. This is read-only research.
- Do NOT skip any directory — be exhaustive.
- If a file is large (>200 lines), read enough to understand its purpose but you don't need to reproduce it.
- Read JOURNAL.md files in each directory — they often explain what happened.
- If you find files that look like they were generated by scripts, note which script generated them.
