# RME LST Reference Report

Each entry lists an LST file and a referenced asset that was not found
in the RME overlay or the base DATs.

Note: This is a heuristic check that only validates LST entries with
explicit filenames (i.e., tokens containing a '.' extension). Some LST
formats encode non-file data and will not be validated here.
